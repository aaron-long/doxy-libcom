The doxy-libcom repository contains a set of C header files
extracted from the development branch of EPICS Base, along
with Makefile rules to tell GNUmake and Doxygen how to
process those header files.

After checking out the branch, type 'make' at the top to
build the files. Open the html/doxygen/index.html file in
a browser to look at the results. Subsequently you can run
'make' inside the documentation directory to speed things
up a bit.

Various notes for Doxygen:

Please ensure every file begins with these annotations:
    \file <filename>
    \brief <file-description>
We don't have autobrief turned on. The above ensure the
file and its description are included in the file index.
