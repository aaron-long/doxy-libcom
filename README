This repository contains a set of C header (include) files
extracted from the development branch of EPICS Base, along
with a configuration file for Doxygen to tell it how to
process those header files.

Every GitHub pull-request (and subsequent commit to that
branch) made against this repository will be processed by
Doxygen and the results made available on a website where
they can be checked - a link to the results from your pull
request will be sent to you by email when the processing
is finished. If the output wasn't quite what you wanted it
to look like, fix your Doxygen annotations and commit and
push them to your branch (or just commit them if you're
working directly on Github). Doxygen will redo the
processing and you'll get another email when it's ready.
