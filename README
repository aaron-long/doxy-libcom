This repository contains a set of C header (include) files
extracted from the development branch of EPICS Base, along
with enough of the EPICS Build system to be able to run
doxygen against those header files.

Every GitHub pull-request (and subsequent commit to that
branch) made against this repository will be processed by
Jenkins and the results made available on a website where
they can be checked - a link to the results from your pull
request will be sent to you by email when the processing
is finished. If the output wasn't quite what you wanted it
to look like, fix your Doxygen annotations, commit them
and commit and push to the same branch. Jenkins will redo
the processing and send you another email when it's ready.
